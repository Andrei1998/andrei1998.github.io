I am a third-year :romania: [PhD student](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/aconstantine) advised by [Prof. Roger Wattenhofer](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/wroger) in the [Distributed Computing Group](https://disco.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). :switzerland:

My research centers around **computational aspects of social choice and game theory**. In particular, designing and analyzing mechanisms driving efficiency, stability and fairness of collective decision making.

More broadly, I am interested in **algorithms** and **distributed systems**, currently focusing on **fault-tolerance** and agent **incentives**.

Previously, I completed my Master's degree at the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) :uk:, focusing on advanced, concurrent and probabilistic algorithms and data structures, computational complexity and programming languages theory. 

When not working, during winter you will likely find me on the slopes. :ski:
