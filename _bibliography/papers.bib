  abstract={Convex Consensus (CC) allows a set of parties to agree on a value \(v\) inside the convex hull of their inputs with respect to a predefined convexity notion, even in the presence of byzantine parties. In this work, we focus on achieving CC in the best-of-both-worlds paradigm, i.e., simultaneously tolerating at most \(t_s\) corruptions if communication is synchronous, and at most \(t_a \leq t_s\) corruptions if it is asynchronous. Our protocol is randomized, which is a requirement under asynchrony, and we prove that it achieves optimal resilience.
In the process, we introduce communication primitives tailored to the best-of-both-worlds model, which we believe to be of independent interest. These are a deterministic primitive, which allows honest parties to obtain intersecting views, and a randomized primitive, leading to identical views (which is impossible to achieve deterministically).
Afterwards, we consider achieving consensus using deterministic protocols, for which the agreement condition must be appropriately relaxed depending on the convexity space. For the relevant case of graph convexity spaces, we find that a previous asynchronous approximate agreement protocol for chordal graphs is incorrect, and hereby give a new protocol for the problem designed for the best-of-both-worlds model and achieving tight point-wise resilience bounds. Finally, we show that asynchronous graph approximate agreement remains unsolvable by deterministic protocols even when corruptions are restricted to at most two crashing nodes and the distance agreement threshold is linear in the size of the graph.},

  title={A Fair and Resilient Decentralized Clock Network for Transaction Ordering}, 
  author={Constantinescu, Andrei and Ghinea, Diana and Heimbach, Lioba and Wang, Zilin and Wattenhofer, Roger},
  year={2023},
  arxiv={2305.05206},
  abstract={Traditional blockchain design gives miners or validators full control over transaction ordering, i.e., they can freely choose which transactions to include or exclude, as well as in which order. While not an issue initially, the emergence of decentralized finance has introduced new transaction order dependencies allowing parties in control of the ordering to make a profit by front-running others' transactions.
In this work, we present the Decentralized Clock Network, a new approach for achieving fair transaction ordering. Users submit their transactions to the network's clocks, which run an agreement protocol that provides each transaction with a timestamp of receipt which is then used to define the transactions' order. By separating agreement from ordering, our protocol is efficient and has a simpler design compared to other available solutions. Moreover, our protocol brings to the blockchain world the paradigm of asynchronous fallback, where the algorithm operates with stronger fairness guarantees during periods of synchronous use, switching to an asynchronous mode only during times of increased network delay.},

  abstract={A group of \(n\) agents with numerical preferences for each other are to be assigned to the $n$ seats of a dining table. We study two natural topologies:~circular (cycle) tables and panel (path) tables. For a given seating arrangement, an agent's utility is the sum of their preference values towards their (at most two) direct neighbors. An arrangement is envy-free if no agent strictly prefers someone else's seat, and it is stable if no two agents strictly prefer each other's seats. Recently, it was shown that for both paths and cycles it is NP-hard to decide whether an envy-free arrangement exists, even for symmetric binary preferences. In contrast, we show that, if agents come from a bounded number of classes, the problem is solvable in polynomial time for arbitrarily-valued possibly asymmetric preferences, including outputting an arrangement if possible. We also give simpler proofs of the previous hardness results if preferences are allowed to be asymmetric. For stability, it is known that deciding the existence of stable arrangements is NP-hard for both topologies, but only if sufficiently-many numerical values are allowed. As it turns out, even constructing unstable instances can be challenging in certain cases, e.g., binary values. We propose a complete characterization of the existence of stable arrangements based on the number of distinct values in the preference matrix and the number of agent classes. We also ask the same question for non-negative values and give an almost-complete characterization, the most interesting outstanding case being that of paths with two-valued non-negative preferences, for which we experimentally find that stable arrangements always exist and prove it under the additional constraint that agents can only swap seats when sitting at most two positions away. Similarly to envy-freeness, we also give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining a stable arrangement assuming a bounded number of classes. We moreover consider the swap dynamics and exhibit instances where they do not converge, despite a stable arrangement existing.},

  abstract={An electorate with fully-ranked innate preferences casts approval votes over a finite set of alternatives. As a result, only partial information about the true preferences is revealed to the voting authorities. In an effort to understand the nature of the true preferences given only partial information, one might ask whether the unknown innate preferences could possibly be single-crossing. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to determine this has been asked as an outstanding problem in the works of Elkind and Lackner. We hereby give a polynomial time algorithm determining a single-crossing collection of fully-ranked preferences that could have induced the elicited approval ballots, or reporting the nonexistence thereof. Moreover, we consider the problem of identifying negative instances with a set of forbidden sub-ballots, showing that any such characterization requires infinitely many forbidden configurations.},

  abstract={An assembly of \(n\) voters needs to decide on \(t\) independent binary issues. Each voter has opinions about the issues, given by a \(t\)-bit vector. Anscombe's paradox shows that a policy following the majority opinion in each issue may not survive a vote by the very same set of \(n\) voters, i.e., more voters may feel unrepresented by such a majority-driven policy than represented. A natural resolution is to come up with a policy that deviates a bit from the majority policy but no longer gets more opposition than support from the electorate.
We show that a Hamming distance to the majority policy of at most \(\lfloor(t - 1) / 2\rfloor\) can always be guaranteed, by giving a new probabilistic argument relying on structure-preserving symmetries of the space of potential policies.
Unless the electorate is evenly divided between the two options on all issues, we in fact show that a policy strictly winning the vote exists within this distance bound. 
Our approach also leads to a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for finding policies with the stated guarantees, answering an open problem of previous work. For odd \(t\), unless we are in the pathological case described above, we also give a simpler and more efficient algorithm running in expected polynomial time with the same guarantees.
We further show that checking whether distance strictly less than \(\lfloor(t - 1) / 2\rfloor\) can be achieved is NP-hard, and that checking for distance at most some input \(k\) is FPT with respect to several natural parameters.},

  abstract  = {We introduce two-crossing elections as a generalization of single-crossing elections, showing a number of new results. First, we show that two-crossing elections can be recognized in polynomial time, by reduction to the well-studied consecutive ones problem. We also conjecture that recognizing \(k\)-crossing elections is NP-complete in general, providing evidence by relating to a problem similar to consecutive ones proven to be hard in the literature. Single-crossing elections exhibit a transitive majority relation, from which many important results follow. On the other hand, we show that the classical Debord-McGarvey theorem can still be proven two-crossing, implying that any weighted majority tournament is inducible by a two-crossing election. This shows that many voting rules are NP-hard under two-crossing elections, including Kemeny and Slater. This is in contrast to the single-crossing case and outlines an important complexity boundary between single- and two-crossing. Subsequently, we show that for two-crossing elections the Young scores of all candidates can be computed in polynomial time, by formulating a totally unimodular linear program. Finally, we consider the Chamberlin-Courant rule with arbitrary disutilities and show that a winning committee can be computed in polynomial time, using an approach based on dynamic programming.},

  abstract={We study the complexity of determining a winning committee under the Chamberlin--Courant voting rule when voters' preferences are single-crossing on a line, or, more generally, on a tree. For the  line, Skowron et al. (2015) describe an \(O(n^2mk)\) algorithm 
(where \(n\), \(m\), \(k\) are the number of voters, the number of candidates and the committee size, respectively); we show that a simple tweak improves the time complexity to \(O(nmk)\). We then improve this bound for \(k=\Omega(\log n)\) by reducing our problem to the \(k\)-link path problem for DAGs with concave Monge weights, obtaining a
\(nm2^{O\left(\sqrt{\log k\log\log n}\right)}\) algorithm for the general case and a nearly linear algorithm for the Borda misrepresentation function. For trees, we point out an issue with the algorithm proposed by Clearwater, Puppe, and Slinko (2015), 
and develop a \(O(nmk)\) algorithm for this case as well.},
