  abstract={An assembly of \(n\) voters needs to decide on \(t\) independent binary issues. Each voter has opinions about the issues, given by a \(t\)-bit vector. Anscombe's paradox shows that a policy following the majority opinion in each issue may not survive a vote by the very same set of \(n\) voters, i.e., more voters may feel unrepresented by such a majority-driven policy than represented. A natural resolution is to come up with a policy that deviates a bit from the majority policy but no longer gets more opposition than support from the electorate.
We show that a Hamming distance to the majority policy of at most \(\lfloor(t - 1) / 2\rfloor\) can always be guaranteed, by giving a new probabilistic argument relying on structure-preserving symmetries of the space of potential policies.
Unless the electorate is evenly divided between the two options on all issues, we in fact show that a policy strictly winning the vote exists within this distance bound. 
Our approach also leads to a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for finding policies with the stated guarantees, answering an open problem of previous work. For odd \(t\), unless we are in the pathological case described above, we also give a simpler and more efficient algorithm running in expected polynomial time with the same guarantees.
We further show that checking whether distance strictly less than \(\lfloor(t - 1) / 2\rfloor\) can be achieved is NP-hard, and that checking for distance at most some input \(k\) is FPT with respect to several natural parameters.},

  abstract={We study the complexity of determining a winning committee under the Chamberlin--Courant voting rule when voters' preferences are single-crossing on a line, or, more generally, on a tree. For the  line, Skowron et al. (2015) describe an \(O(n^2mk)\) algorithm 
(where \(n\), \(m\), \(k\) are the number of voters, the number of candidates and the committee size, respectively); we show that a simple tweak improves the time complexity to \(O(nmk)\). We then improve this bound for \(k=\Omega(\log n)\) by reducing our problem to the \(k\)-link path problem for DAGs with concave Monge weights, obtaining a
\(nm2^{O\left(\sqrt{\log k\log\log n}\right)}\) algorithm for the general case and a nearly linear algorithm for the Borda misrepresentation function. For trees, we point out an issue with the algorithm proposed by Clearwater, Puppe, and Slinko (2015), 
and develop a \(O(nmk)\) algorithm for this case as well.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
